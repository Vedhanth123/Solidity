# Steps for deploying FundMe contract

Aim:

1) Deploy FundMe contract
2) FundMe contract must be able to deploy to many testnets
3) FundMe contract uses chainlink smart contracts
4) We provide chainlink contract addresses to deploy scripts which help us to deploy to many testnets
5) We then create a mock contract which helps us to provide the price of Eth to localhost also
6) We then make some minor changes to the smart contract
